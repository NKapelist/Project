For the development of the project, have been used such instruments as:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/uk/) - an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side;
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - a web-based hosting service for version control using git;
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - a module bundler;
- [SCSS](https://sass-scss.ru/guide/) - extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, including object-oriented languages, but not available for CSS.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces;
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - template engine and an html preprocessor written in javascript for node.js.
